# Price-indices
Place to store Price indices. This includes Unit price, double chain link for unit price, and daily chained (monthly, weekly and daily).

A daily unit price index is equivalent to a fixed basket Jevons Price Index.

The Daily Chained Jevons Price index is a Jevons Price index where the base period is at t-1 (yesterday), compared to t (today). The price indices for each consecutive set of days are then chained together.
